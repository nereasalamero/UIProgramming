**Summary:** Group project for User Interface Programming.

The goal of this project is to code a food delivery application for placing orders using Flet. In order to do this we've designed the UI design using the tool Figma. Once that was finished, we distributed all the tasks that needed to be done among the group members and we started working on it.

Thanks to the use of GitHub platform we have been able to maintain version control that has allowed us to return to a previous version of the code if necessary. We have also used GitHub Issues, which is a very useful tool when assigning tasks and having control of what remains to be done at all times.
